Sexual Dimorphism in the Brain: Group Comparison of resting-state fMRI data using Index Component Analysis (ICA)Objectives	The project aimed to investigate sexual dimorphism in the human brain by leveraging resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) data from the Human Connectome Project. Our primary goal was to explore whether gender can be accurately predicted using a minimal set of brain components derived through Independent Component Analysis (ICA). We focused on identifying patterns and group differences in functional connectivity that could robustly distinguish male and female participants while minimizing the number of components needed to achieve accurate classification.Main ResultsThe analysis identified 25 independent components that effectively captured meaningful variability in resting-state brain activity across genders. Using machine learning models trained on these components, we achieved a substantial degree of accuracy in predicting gender, demonstrating that even a reduced dataset can capture significant gender-related differences in brain connectivity. Key components were linked to regions and networks previously implicated in functional specialization and connectivity, offering insights into how sexual dimorphism manifests in brain dynamics. Our findings also highlighted the value of ICA in reducing data complexity while preserving critical patterns of interest.ConclusionThis project underscores the potential of ICA in analyzing large-scale brain imaging datasets and its utility in uncovering neural correlates of biological distinctions, such as gender. By demonstrating that meaningful predictions can be made with a reduced set of components, we provide a foundation for future studies aiming to simplify brain-behavior analyses without compromising accuracy. The results contribute to the growing understanding of sexual dimorphism in the brain and demonstrate the feasibility of using advanced computational approaches to address complex neuroscientific questions. However it is important to emphasize the importance of cautious interpretation. Gender is a complex and multidimensional construct, and binary classification only scratches the surface. Future work could expand on this by exploring how individual variability or other factors contribute to these differences.My ContributionsMy role in the project was to connect the research to the neurocognitive literature to justify our research question. I worked on grounding our approach in existing studies and making the case for why investigating sexual dimorphism in this way was important. Investigating the existing literature on the issue, then looking at out findings and linking them back to the literature was particularly rewarding, as it allowed me to bridge the technical work with the broader context of neuroscience. This project provided valuable experience in combining theoretical insights with data-driven analysis, and I was thrilled to be part of a team tackling such an intriguing topic.     Bora Gazidede (12308690) 	                                   Project Summary & Individual Contributions
